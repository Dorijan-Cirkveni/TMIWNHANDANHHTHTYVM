## About the mod

The Mod In Which Natsuki Has A Nice Day And Nothing Horrible Happens To Her, Thank You Very Much (TMIWNHANDANHHTHTYVM) is a work-in-progress mod in which...you get the point.

This is the non-public debug update. If you're reading this, you're either a tester or the mod has been released.

Like all other DDLC mods, it is supposed to be played AFTER the main game and it requires the main game to even run.
Just download the mod from here and copy the content into a clean install of DDLC.
